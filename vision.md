### **BashNota: The Future of Collaborative Computing & Knowledge Management**  

**BashNota** is an **offline-first, open-source** platform that **combines the best of Notion, Jupyter, Kaggle, Colab, and Hugging Face** into a single, unified workspace.  

🚀 **It’s a PWA (Progressive Web App), meaning you can use it entirely offline** without needing to sign in. However, signing in unlocks **cloud sync, team collaboration, publishing, and community features.**
