# Router (`src/router`)

This directory contains the routing configuration for the Vue application, using `vue-router`.

## Files

-   **`index.ts`**: This is the central file for routing. It creates the router instance, defines all the application's routes (mapping URLs to components), and can include navigation guards for authentication and other purposes.
