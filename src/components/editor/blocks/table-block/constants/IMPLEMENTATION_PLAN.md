- [x] Add event handling system
- [x] Create event creation/editing interface
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop support
- [ ] Implement recurring events
- [x] Add event categories and colors
- [x] Implement event filtering and sorting
- [x] Add day details modal
- [x] Implement event status and priority

### 3. Kanban Board Layout
- [x] Create KanbanLayout component
- [x] Implement column management
- [x] Add card creation/editing
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop between columns
- [x] Add column-specific settings

- [x] Implement card filtering
- [x] Add card status tracking

### 4. Timeline Layout
- [ ] Create TimelineLayout component
- [ ] Implement horizontal/vertical timeline views
- [ ] Add milestone tracking
- [ ] Create dependency visualization
- [ ] Implement zoom controls
- [ ] Add timeline-specific data organization
- [ ] Implement timeline navigation
- [ ] Add timeline markers and annotations
- [ ] Create timeline event cards
- [ ] Implement timeline grouping
- [ ] Add timeline export/import
- [ ] Implement timeline sharing

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies to Add
- [x] shadcn-vue components
- [x] Lucide icons
- [x] Chart library (Chart.js)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop library (vueuse/core usedraggable)
- [ ] Timeline visualization library (TBD)

### Code Organization
- [x] Create layout-specific composables
- [x] Implement layout-specific types
- [x] Set up layout-specific constants
- [x] Create shared utilities
- [ ] Add timeline-specific utilities
- [ ] Create timeline data transformers

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for each layout
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Timeline-specific tests

## Implementation Order
1. Chart Layout (Completed)
   - Most common use case
   - Relatively straightforward implementation
   - Good foundation for other layouts

2. Kanban Board Layout (Mostly Complete)
   - Popular for project management
   - Complex but well-defined structure
   - Good for testing drag-and-drop

3. Calendar Layout (Mostly Complete)
   - Natural extension of table data
   - Complex date handling
   - Event management system

4. Timeline Layout (Next Priority)
   - Most complex implementation
   - Requires careful data organization
   - Advanced visualization features

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Phase 1: Chart Layout Implementation (Basic Structure)
- [x] Phase 2: Chart Layout Implementation (Visualization)
- [x] Phase 3: Kanban Board Implementation (Basic Structure)
- [ ] Phase 4: Kanban Board Implementation (Drag and Drop)
- [x] Phase 5: Calendar Implementation (Basic Structure)
- [x] Phase 6: Calendar Implementation (Event Management)
- [ ] Phase 7: Calendar Implementation (Drag and Drop)
- [ ] Phase 8: Timeline Implementation (Basic Structure)
- [ ] Phase 9: Timeline Implementation (Visualization)
- [ ] Phase 10: Timeline Implementation (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Phase 11: Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Phase 12: Documentation and Polish

## Next Steps
1. Complete Calendar Layout
   - Implement drag-and-drop for events
   - Add recurring events support
   - Optimize performance for large datasets

2. Complete Kanban Board Layout
   - Implement drag-and-drop between columns
   - Add column reordering
   - Optimize card rendering

3. Begin Timeline Layout Implementation
   - Research and select timeline visualization library
   - Create basic timeline structure
   - Implement timeline navigation
   - Add milestone tracking
   - Implement dependency visualization
   - Add advanced features (zoom, markers, etc.)

## Notes
- Each layout will be implemented as a separate component
- Shared functionality will be extracted into composables
- Layout-specific state will be managed independently
- All layouts will maintain data consistency with the base table
- Performance optimization will be a key consideration
- Timeline implementation will require careful consideration of data structure and visualization options
