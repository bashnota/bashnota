# Table Block Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing different table layouts in the table-block component, including charts, calendar, kanban board, and timeline views.

## Architecture Changes
1. [x] Create a new layout system
   - [x] Implement a layout switcher component
   - [x] Create a layout registry system
   - [x] Add layout-specific state management
   - [x] Implement layout-specific data transformations

2. [x] Set up shared components
   - [x] Create a base table layout component
   - [x] Implement shared controls and actions
   - [x] Set up shadcn components integration
   - [x] Add Lucide icons integration

## Layout Implementations

### 1. Chart Layout
- [x] Create ChartLayout component
- [x] Implement chart type selection (bar, line, pie, etc.)
- [x] Add chart configuration options
- [x] Integrate with chart library (Chart.js)
- [x] Add data visualization controls
- [x] Implement chart-specific data transformations

### 2. Calendar Layout
- [ ] Create CalendarLayout component
- [ ] Implement month/week/day views
- [ ] Add event handling system
- [ ] Create event creation/editing interface
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop support
- [ ] Implement recurring events

### 3. Kanban Board Layout
- [x] Create KanbanLayout component
- [x] Implement column management
- [x] Add card creation/editing
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop between columns
- [x] Add column-specific settings
- [x] Create card templates

### 4. Timeline Layout
- [ ] Create TimelineLayout component
- [ ] Implement horizontal/vertical timeline views
- [ ] Add milestone tracking
- [ ] Create dependency visualization
- [ ] Implement zoom controls
- [ ] Add timeline-specific data organization

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies to Add
- [x] shadcn-vue components
- [x] Lucide icons
- [x] Chart library (Chart.js)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop library (TBD)

### Code Organization
- [x] Create layout-specific composables
- [x] Implement layout-specific types
- [x] Set up layout-specific constants
- [x] Create shared utilities

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for each layout
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing

## Implementation Order
1. Chart Layout (First priority)
   - Most common use case
   - Relatively straightforward implementation
   - Good foundation for other layouts

2. Kanban Board Layout
   - Popular for project management
   - Complex but well-defined structure
   - Good for testing drag-and-drop

3. Calendar Layout
   - Natural extension of table data
   - Complex date handling
   - Event management system

4. Timeline Layout
   - Most complex implementation
   - Requires careful data organization
   - Advanced visualization features

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Phase 1: Chart Layout Implementation (Basic Structure)
- [x] Phase 2: Chart Layout Implementation (Visualization)
- [x] Phase 3: Kanban Board Implementation (Basic Structure)
- [ ] Phase 4: Kanban Board Implementation (Drag and Drop)
- [ ] Phase 5: Calendar Implementation
- [ ] Phase 6: Timeline Implementation
- [ ] Phase 7: Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Phase 8: Documentation and Polish

## Notes
- Each layout will be implemented as a separate component
- Shared functionality will be extracted into composables
- Layout-specific state will be managed independently
- All layouts will maintain data consistency with the base table
- Performance optimization will be a key consideration
