# Constants (`src/constants`)

This directory contains files that export application-wide constants. These constants are used to maintain consistency and avoid hard-coded values throughout the codebase.

## Files

-   **`app.ts`**: This file exports a wide range of constants used throughout the application. This includes default settings, configuration keys, identifiers for UI elements, and other static values that need to be accessed from different parts of the application.
