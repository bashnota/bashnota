## 3. Code Execution

### Python Code Block

1. Type "/" and select "Code Block"
2. Choose "Python" as the language
3. Enter a simple Python code:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', label='sin(x)')
plt.title('Simple Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
4. Click the "Run" button to execute the code
5. Observe the output with the sine wave plot

### Creating a New Session

1. Click on the session selector (layers icon)
2. Select "New Session"
3. Name it "Data Analysis"
4. Create another code block:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample dataframe
data = {
